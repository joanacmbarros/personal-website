Hi 👋 

I'm a Data Scientist and R programmer.

I completed my PhD in Computer Science in 2020, and since then, I've been working in the pharmaceutical industry. Before pharma, I was deep in the Machine Learning and Deep Learning trenches, doing [research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5QKWqrIAAAAJ&hl=en) in Cheminformatics and Health Informatics. Nowadays, I’m more interested in practical, real-world applications of data science—specifically how we can leverage current tools and technologies to streamline day-to-day operations. 

In my role as a Clinical Data Scientist, I focus on developing solutions to help our Biometry team while also exploring ways to make this process [easier in the future](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01789-2) and create more opportunities.

When I'm not coding and thinking hard about technical problems, I like to help [bring like-minded people together](https://baselbiometrics.github.io/home/docs/nextgen.html) and organize [conferences](https://iscb2025.info/committees.html). And when I’m not doing *that*, I enjoy swimming 🏊️, traveling 🗺️, and reading 📖 — though let’s be honest, I don’t do enough of any of those. But hey, we all need a little room for improvement, right?
