    "text": "Hi 👋\nI’m a Data Scientist and R programmer.\nI completed my PhD in Computer Science in 2020, and since then, I’ve been working in the pharmaceutical industry. Before pharma, I was deep in the Machine Learning and Deep Learning trenches, doing research in Cheminformatics and Health Informatics. Nowadays, I’m more interested in practical, real-world applications of data science—specifically how we can leverage current tools and technologies to streamline day-to-day operations.\nIn my role as a Clinical Data Scientist, I focus on developing solutions to help our Biometry team while also exploring ways to make this process easier in the future and create more opportunities.\nWhen I’m not coding and thinking hard about technical problems, I like to help bring like-minded people together and organize conferences. And when I’m not doing that, I enjoy swimming 🏊️, traveling 🗺️, and reading 📖 — though let’s be honest, I don’t do enough of any of those. But hey, we all need a little room for improvement, right?"
